# Cloud Folder

This project aims to create a 'folder' on cloud (IPFS/Filecoin) for users, which supports uploading, downloading, editing, sharing, etc. We will add a permission system on it to enable users to specify different permissions when sharing, such as read-only, editable, etc. We will also provide a file sharing solution suitable for organizations.
